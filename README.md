# ClojureSpec-JS

Port of [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) to JS, for
specifying, validating, and testing data structures.

(Yes, this loses most of the beauty of clojure.spec that comes from
being made in clojure... but we can still take advantage of the
features that we do get :) )

## References

Basically no part of this project is my original work. It is entirely
based upon:

- [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) (duh)
- [testcheck-js](https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js) (from which
  I copied this project's structure/build system)
