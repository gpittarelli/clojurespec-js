# ClojureSpec-JS

Port of [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) to JS, for
specifying, validating, and testing data structures.

(Yes, this loses most of the beauty of clojure.spec that comes from
being made in clojure... but we can still take advantage of the
features that we do get :) )

In future, maybe I could also use this library as a bridge to bring
the features that ship with clojure.spec to similar schema/joi/etc
libraries in the js world. Doing some sort of babel plugin to convert
clojure specs to flow declarations would be nice as well :)

## References

Basically no part of this project is my original work. It is entirely
based upon:

- [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) (duh)
- [testcheck-js](https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js) (from which
  I copied this project's structure/build system)
