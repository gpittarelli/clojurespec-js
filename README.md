# ClojureSpec-JS

Port of [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) to JS, for
specifying, validating, and testing data structures.

## References

Basically no part of this project is my original work. It is entirely
based upon:

- [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) (duh)
- [testcheck-js](https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js) (from which
  I copied this project's structure/build system)
